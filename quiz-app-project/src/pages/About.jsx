        This web app is a high-performance assessment platform designed to bring
        a vast global knowledge base directly to your fingertips. By integrating
        an expansive real-time API, the engine generates fresh sets of
        challenges every time you hit "Start." Our mission was to build a clean,
        responsive interface that handles complex subject categories and various
        difficulty levels while maintaining a light and ultra-fast user
        experience. This project serves as a bridge between massive data sets
        and a streamlined, distraction-free environment for testing your
        intellect.
